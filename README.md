A continuation of [this project](https://github.com/MichaelVerdegaal/hotel-reviews-sentiment-analysis), where we host the data in a NoSQL environment this time,

# Data
The kaggle reviews file is too large to host on github, but it can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jiashenliu/515k-hotel-reviews-data-in-europe).
